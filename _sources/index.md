# ELEC 221 Signals and Systems

## Learning Goals

- Understand and analyze continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems.
- Apply Laplace and Fourier transforms to analyze and solve problems in signal processing.
- Study the properties and applications of Z-transforms in discrete-time systems.
- Explore sampling theory and its implications for signal conversion between continuous and discrete domains.
- Perform frequency analysis using Fourier series and transforms.
- Implement signal processing techniques using Python and relevant libraries such as SciPy and Jupyter.
- Analyze digital signals using the discrete Fourier transform.
- Design and analyze state-space representations of dynamic systems.
