# Frequency Analysis: Fourier Transforms

```{div} bigidea
Record the row operations of the Gaussian elimination algorithm in the LU decomposition and use the decomposition $A = LU$ in backward/forward subsitution to efficiently solve a system of linear equations $A \boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{b}$.
